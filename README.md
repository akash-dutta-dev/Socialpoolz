## Our Aim

Our Aim is to provide enormous knowledge to those people who seek for it. Knowledge is something which has a beginning but no end. Reading is something which our World specially need, rather than scrolling some unnecessary post. The only source of knowledge is experience, so we provide experienced expert who work 24x7 to provide relevant answer to your precious questions. We would like us to be called Knowledge Resourcing website rather than Social Networking website.
